 * The digital signature of a document in a web environment is performed in three steps:
 * 1. Creating a byte stream representing the data to be signed.
 * 2. Hashing of the data previously obtained and its encryption.
 * 3. The creation of the envelope containing all the elements of a digital signature.
 * The process is controlled by a set of parameters.
